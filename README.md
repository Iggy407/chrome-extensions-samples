# Ideas

(NEW) Use the CSV_download chrome extension for the two kaggle pages below. 

Try to use the CSV_Filename_Detector on kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset), and test on another dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/leukemia-cancer-risk-prediction-dataset.

(This is still work in progress) And the combined CSV and Excel detector on https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bvxrgng7y2/1.

## Overview

The CSV_download chrome extension is able to find and download the CSV file with 1 click. We might be able to use something similar to import it directly into the website. 

At the moment the extension is able to find the name of the CSV file from kaggle. I think coding the extension such that the CSV from kaggle is directly imported into the LION website is possible and probably easier than the excel file as a downloadable document: [https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls). The mendeley page should also work because uses a  HTML span element to identify the xls files e.g., `<span class="name" title="Voronoi_10.xlsx">`.

## Details (do not read unless you have time)

**CSV_download**: This JavaScript IIFE automates clicking a download button and a download area on a webpage. The `clickDownloadButton` function locates and clicks a button (`button.sc-edmcci.cKvyOD.sc-dubKuk.ksfWT`), retrying every 500ms if not found. Similarly, `initiateDownload` clicks a download area (`.sc-gQkENW.hyybuT`), also retrying if necessary. The script checks if the page is fully loaded before executionâ€”if so, it runs immediately; otherwise, it waits for the load event. It first clicks the button, then waits 500ms before clicking the download area. If elements are missing, it keeps retrying. This automation simulates user interaction to facilitate downloads.

**CSV_Filename_Detector**: The provided `content.js` script is designed to locate and extract the text content of a specific HTML element on a webpage. It first attempts to find a `<p>` element with a precise combination of classes (`p.sc-gQaihK.sc-bwmSDE.bwaGMg.eYOaSs`). If this element is not found, it falls back to a more generic approach, searching for any `<p>` element that contains a class starting with `"sc-"`. If either of these elements is found, the script retrieves the text content of the element, which is assumed to be a CSV filename, and logs it to the console. If no matching element is found, it logs a message indicating that the CSV filename element could not be located. This script is useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically extract specific data from a webpage's DOM structure.
